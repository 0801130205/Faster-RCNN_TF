# Faster-RCNN_TF

This is an experimental Tensorflow implementation of Faster RCNN - a convnet for object detection with a region proposal network.
For details about R-CNN please refer to the paper [Faster R-CNN: Towards Real-Time Object Detection with Region Proposal Networks](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.01497v3.pdf) by Shaoqing Ren, Kaiming He, Ross Girshick, Jian Sun.


### Requirements: software

1. Requirements for Tensorflow (see: [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/))

2. Python packages you might not have: `cython`, `python-opencv`, `easydict`

### Requirements: hardware

1. For training the end-to-end version of Faster R-CNN with VGG16, 3G of GPU memory is sufficient (using CUDNN)

### Installation (sufficient for the demo)

1. Clone the Faster R-CNN repository
  ```Shell
  # Make sure to clone with --recursive
  git clone --recursive https://github.com/smallcorgi/Faster-RCNN_TF.git
  ```

2. We'll call the directory that you cloned Faster R-CNN into `FRCN_ROOT`

   *Ignore notes 1 and 2 if you followed step 1 above.*

   **Note 1:** If you didn't clone Faster R-CNN with the `--recursive` flag, then you'll need to manually clone the `caffe-fast-rcnn` submodule:
    ```Shell
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    ```
    **Note 2:** The `caffe-fast-rcnn` submodule needs to be on the `faster-rcnn` branch (or equivalent detached state). This will happen automatically *if you followed step 1 instructions*.

3. Build the Cython modules
    ```Shell
    cd $FRCN_ROOT/lib
    sh make.sh
    ```

### Demo

*After successfully completing [basic installation](#installation-sufficient-for-the-demo)*, you'll be ready to run the demo.

To run the demo
```Shell
cd $FRCN_ROOT
./tools/demo.py
```
The demo performs detection using a VGG16 network trained for detection on PASCAL VOC 2007.
